## Bring in estimates from file for Census, Flu, and COVID
### Also estimate total critical nurses needed by 4:1 ratio



## Bring in recent weekly tags for potential staffing shortage by facility


## Bring in Length of Stay 






## For each hospital, I want the map displayed, I want the closest potential partner hospitals highlighted
## I also want on each click, or via dropdown, for the graphs to all show. I want this all on one panel. 

## On the next panel I want the map with circles that highlight currently selected hospitals and on hover, 

## I think want a scenario builder: Number of minor, moderate and intensive patients (peds and adults?) 

## Find closest similar rural, urb, transfer centers and pull if they're gonna be short staffed, how far from max capacity they are.
  ### Also do patients/4 for minor, 2 for moderate, 1 for intensive, see if additional nurses may need to be called in. If over capacity
  ### If over max capacity, boot and transfer to next closes facility and so on.
